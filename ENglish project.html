    <h1 class="heading-with-background">Exploring Mental Captivity Through Real-World Connections</h1>
    <div style="line-height: 1.5;">
        <p><strong>George Washington Black, or "Wash," an eleven-year-old field slave on a Barbados sugar plantation, is terrified to be chosen by his master's brother as his manservant. To 
        his surprise, the eccentric Christopher Wilde turns out to be a naturalist, explorer, inventor, and abolitionist. Soon Wash is initiated into a world where a flying machine 
        can carry a man across the sky, where even a boy born in chains may embrace a life of dignity and meaning - and where two people, separated by an impossible divide, can begin 
        to see each other as human. But when a man is killed and a bounty is placed on Wash's head, Christopher and Wash must abandon everything. What follows is their flight along 
        the eastern coast of America, and, finally, to a remote outpost in the Arctic. What brings Christopher and Wash together will tear them apart, propelling Wash even further 
        across the globe in search of his true self.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>From the blistering cane fields of the Caribbean to the frozen Far North, from the earliest aquariums of London to the eerie deserts of Morocco, Washington Black tells a story of 
        self-invention and betrayal, of love and redemption, of a world destroyed and made whole again, and asks the question, What is true freedom?</strong></p>  

        <p><strong>This is also my question, we can see that in our great country Canada there are still some invisible captivities people have to face for hundreds of years. These problems should 
        not have such a dramatic impact on the human community but unfortunately there are still people struggling to overcome the problems to break through the restrictions.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Philip - Erasmus and Titch brother, once said: “Perhaps it is easier for you,” he said again. “Everything is taken care of for you. You needn’t worry about what the coming days 
        will hold, as every day is the same. Your only expectations are the expectations your master lays out for you. It is a simple-enough life, what.” This makes me realize that being 
        captive to expectations, or perhaps simply mentality, can be just as harmful as physical captivity.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>In this exhibition, we show you the 4 reasons why people are being imprisoned in their mental jail. Explore the cause and how people are dealing with them worldwide.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>“Everything is taken care of for you. You needn’t worry about what the coming days will hold, as every day is the same. Your only expectations are the expectations your 
        master lays out for you. It is a simple-enough life, what.”</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Even when someone like Philip or Titch has physical freedom, they can still feel trapped by other burdens. In Philip's case, his mention of 'expectations' hints 
        at the emotional toll they can take. His eventual suicide underscores how being captive to these expectations, or perhaps just to sadness, can be as damaging as physical 
        confinement. Despite being part of a white family, they still face mental imprisonment, striving to meet parental expectations but feeling trapped in their own minds</p>
        
        <p><strong>Do you ever feel more shy around your family?</strong></p>
        <p>Do you feel weird being around people your own age when someone in your family is around?</p>
        <p>How about talking to someone of the opposite sex <span style="text-decoration: underline;">when your parents are watching</span>?</p>
        <p>Does it feel weird when you try to be more outgoing and sometimes seem like your family wants you to keep being shy?</p>
        <p><strong>There are several reasons why you feel this way, and 3 major ones:</strong></p>
        <h3>Reason 1: You Care What They Think</h3>
        <p>This is the biggie. <strong>It’s hard not to care what your family thinks.</strong> You may worry they judge how you act, who you know or what clothes you wear. If you’re a teenager or living at or near your parent’s home, it can be even more difficult.</p>
        <p>One way to stop caring so much is to get a life. I mean it. Seek out new friends, new interests, and outside groups. If you have a life outside of the house you’ll stop caring as much about what your family thinks because they will become only part of your life, instead of being there always.</p>
        <p>By the way, I know “get outside interests and friends” is a lot easier to say than it is to actually do. <strong>I know what it’s like to be shy and feel stuck inside the house. </strong>It’s like having an invisible barrier holding you down and you wish something would just “snap” and make your life better.</p>
        <h3>Reason 2: Won’t They Notice If You Change?</h3>
        <p>You’re afraid of suddenly acting more confident and talking less quiet because <strong>you don’t want your family to notice.</strong> This goes back to Reason 1, But there’s actually a much easier solution for this feeling.</p>
        <p>Yes, they may notice you changing, but <strong>they won’t mind</strong>. If they do, it’s because they feel like they’re “losing control” over you. Some outgoing people feel more important around shy people because they like being able to boss them around and dominate over them. If your family doesn’t want you to change, hang around them less (see #1).</p>
        <p>Also, it’s generally expected that shy people <strong>need some time to “break out of their shell”</strong>. You won’t really be surprising anyone.</p>
        <h3>Reason 3: They Know You’re Shy</h3>
        <p>It’s very <strong>hard to change the impression of you</strong> that your family has built up over many years. Maybe they see you as “a shy person”. The worst part about this is, the impression they’ve built up is like an elastic band. There’s no way to gradually make them see you as a more and more confident person. It will just snap back to “shy guy/girl”.</p>
        <p><strong>Get away for a bit.</strong> If you’re leaving for college or moving to a new, faraway job soon, that would be the best solution.</p>
        <p>If they only start to see you occasionally, instead of every day, they will have to <strong>reevaluate and change their initial impression of you</strong>. They expect you to change if they haven’t seen you for a while. There’s also a second bonus to getting away.</p>
        <h3>People Have Expectations They Expect You To Live Up To</h3>
        <p><strong>People generally behave as others expect them to behave.</strong> If your friends know you are shy, they won’t like it if you are suddenly loud. That’s not because they don’t want you to stop being shy, but it just seems weird. An outgoing, funny guy who is well-known will have every one’s attention as soon as he enters a room. That’s because everybody expects him to be outgoing and funny, and he plays into that expectation.</p>
        <p><strong>Imagine travelling to a new city.</strong> You could hop onto an airplane, and in a few hours, you’re in a totally different place. You could be who ever you want to be in that place. That’s the feeling “getting away” gives you.</p>
        <p>In a different place, where no one has any expectations of what kind of person you are,&nbsp;<strong>you can “pretend” to be confident</strong> and change a lot more rapidly.</p>
        <p><strong>It’s like an instant shyness cure.</strong></p>

    <h2>Social Expectation</h2>
    <div>
        <p><strong>Navigation of our complex social world is facilitated by shared social expectations that influence behavior. For example, when we go to the movies we wait in line to purchase tickets and turn off our cell phones to comply with social expectations.</strong></p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src='https://everydaypower.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/social-expectations-min.jpg' alt="intro.jpg">
        </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Social expectations play a significant role in shaping human behavior, guiding individuals in navigating their interactions within society.</li>
        <li>For example, common social norms such as waiting in line and turning off cell phones in theaters demonstrate how individuals conform to expected behaviors in various situations.</li>
        <li>When social expectations are violated, conflicts may arise, leading to discomfort or tension within the social environment.</li>
        <li>Research conducted by Clay and colleagues (2016) on bonobos suggests that even non-human primates exhibit responses to violations of social expectations, indicating a fundamental understanding of social norms.</li>
        <li>Gender stereotypes also influence social expectations, dictating certain behaviors as more appropriate for one gender over another.</li>
        <li>For instance, women are often expected to be more altruistic and self-sacrificing, while men are not held to the same standards.</li>
        <li>Studies, such as the meta-analysis by Rand et al. (2016), have shown that these gendered social expectations can impact behavior, with women exhibiting more altruistic tendencies in certain situations, particularly when acting under time pressure.</li>
        <li>Additionally, individuals' identification with traditional gender roles can further influence their behavior, with those conforming more closely to stereotypical feminine traits demonstrating higher levels of altruism.</li>
        <li>These findings highlight the complex interplay between social expectations, gender stereotypes, and behavior, underscoring the importance of understanding and challenging societal norms to promote equality and fairness.</li>

            <p><strong>Gender expectations can limit women's freedom and opportunities, creating a sense of being boxed in by societal norms. Women often face pressure to conform to 
            traditional roles, such as being caretakers or staying quiet and agreeable. This can lead to feelings of frustration and confinement, as women may feel they must prioritize 
            others' needs over their own ambitions or desires.</strong></p>
